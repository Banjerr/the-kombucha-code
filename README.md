The open-source "bible" for kombucha brewers

## A framework geared towards structuring the art and science of brewing kombucha

A software framework is a structure that helps writing software become more efficient. Frameworks provide expert opinions on processes and methods that can make the act of creation much easier and streamlined. Frameworks provide small building blocks which can be compiled together in any number of ways to create any number of new creations. The goal of this book is to create a framework of sorts, compiling all the kombucha knowledge I can muster, to help the world create super tasty and healthful beverages in the comfort of their own homes.

We have entertained the theories about where kombucha came from and a bit of where it's turned up throughout history. Now it's time to get scientific. What makes kombucha so awesome? It all starts with fermentation. By definition, fermentation means the chemical breakdown of a substance by bacteria, yeasts, or other microorganisms, typically involving effervescence and the giving off of heat. It's a technique that has been used since as early as 7200 B.C. to preserve meat, vegetables, and fruits. 

In regards to kombucha the fermentation process involves the SCOBY and the tea, specifically the sugar in the tea. The SCOBY is introduced to the tea and soon begins to form a film on top of the tea as to get as much contact with the nutritent medium (the tea) as possible. The tea is left out covered with a breathable cloth - and the magic of a complex chemical dance begins. Acetic acid bacteria, such as Gluconacetobacter and Acetobacter, and lactic acid bacteria, such as Lactobacillus, work with several yeast populations to inhibit the growth of potential contaminating bacteria. Over a period of about seven to 10 days, they convert the sugar and tea to a lightly carbonated, slightly sour drink composed of amino acids, vitamins and enzymes - that is DELICOUS and NUTRITIOUS!
